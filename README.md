## Install 🛠️
### Extension installation ⚙️
**IMPORTANT:** This application should be ran on a PC with static IP, otherwise Twitch bot won't be able to send commands to extension 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrefHub/kdancybot.git
cd kdancybot
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run -p 7272 -h 0.0.0.0
```
### Twitch bot configuration 👨‍💻
Add commands to whatever twitch bot you are using

Example with Nightbot and request command:
```
$(urlfetch http://(IP | DOMAIN):7272/request?query=$(querystring)&user=$(user))
```
## TODO 💡
* Dockerize bot
* Work with twitch API directly
* Add !np command (idk if it's possible)
* Indicate different roles on channel in request message (VIP, MOD, SUB etc.)
* Indicate map status (ranked, loved, graveyard etc.)
* Add database support
* Add !register command which will store users osu! account ids
* Add **me** alias for commands which require osu usernames
* Cache downloaded osu beatmaps
* Support multiple twitch channels running in one instance
